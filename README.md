This repository contains the two corpora of case reports from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Spanish that were built and annotated for pseudonymization as part of the work presented in the paper "Automatic pseudonymization of case reports from the ECHR in Spanish: evaluation of two different annotation approaches".

As it is mentioned in the paper, the two corpora differ on the annotation procedure: one corpus was annotated by automatically projecting the annotations of the English corpus built by Pilán et al. (2022), and the other corpus was manually annotated by following a reinterpretation of their guidelines.

In addition to that, this repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks display the experiments that were carried out for assessing Flair on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task employing the newly-built corpora.
