This repository contains the corpus of 44 case reports from the [European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/#{%22documentcollectionid2%22:[%22GRANDCHAMBER%22,%22CHAMBER%22]}) in Spanish that was built and annotated as part of the work presented in the paper "Automatic Detection and Labelling of Personal Data in Case Reports from the ECHR in Spanish: Evaluation of Two Different Annotation Approaches".

As it is mentioned in the paper, the corpus was annotated by following two different annotation procedures: automatic projection of the annotations of the English corpus built by Pilán et al. (2022), and manual annotation with a reinterpretation of their guidelines, also based on the work of Arranz et al. (2020).

In addition to that, this repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks display the experiments that were carried out for assessing Flair (Akbik et al., 2018) on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task employing the newly-built corpus.
